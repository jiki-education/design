# Experimentation

This folder is for experimental designs, prototypes, and exploratory work that may not be finalized or ready for production.

## Purpose

Use this space to:
- Try out new design concepts and ideas
- Experiment with different layouts and approaches
- Create quick prototypes without committing to the UI Kit
- Test alternative component styles before adding them to the design system

## Guidelines

- Files in this folder are **not** required to follow the UI Kit standards
- Experiments can be messy, incomplete, or exploratory in nature
- Consider this a sandbox for creative exploration
- Once an experimental design is approved, refine it and move it to the `designs/` folder
- Clean up old experiments periodically to keep the folder manageable

## Organization

Feel free to organize experiments however makes sense:
- By feature/concept (e.g., `new-navigation-idea.html`)
- By date (e.g., `2025-01-concept.html`)
- In subdirectories if working on multiple related experiments
