# Designs

This folder contains finalized HTML design mockups that are ready for implementation by front-end developers.

## Purpose

All design files in this folder should be:
- Complete, polished HTML mockups
- Following the UI Kit standards defined in `../ui-kit/`
- Self-contained with inline CSS for easy sharing
- Production-ready and approved for implementation

## Organization

Designs are organized into sections based on their purpose or feature area. See `index.html` for a complete, categorized list of all available designs.

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames (e.g., `login-page.html`, `user-dashboard.html`)
- For related designs in a flow, use numbered suffixes (e.g., `onboarding-1.html`, `onboarding-2.html`)
- Include the main feature or page type in the filename

## Adding New Designs

When adding a new design:

1. Create the HTML file in this folder
2. Reference components from the UI Kit (`../ui-kit/components.html`)
3. Add the design to the appropriate section in `index.html`
4. If starting a new category, add a new section to `index.html`

## Viewing Designs

Open `index.html` in a browser to see a complete catalog of all available designs with links to each file.
