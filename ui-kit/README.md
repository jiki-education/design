# UI Kit

This folder contains the design system components and guidelines for the jiki-design repository.

## Files

- **components.html** - A visual reference page showcasing all UI components with their various states and variations

## UI Kit Rules

### Purpose
The UI Kit serves as the single source of truth for all design patterns, components, and styles used across designs in this repository.

### Guidelines

1. **Consistency** - All designs in the `designs/` folder should reference and use components defined in this UI Kit
2. **Component Documentation** - Each component in `components.html` should include:
   - Visual examples of all states (default, hover, active, disabled)
   - Variations (sizes, colors, themes)
   - Usage guidelines when applicable

3. **Updates** - When adding new components or styles:
   - First add them to `components.html`
   - Document any specific rules or guidelines in this README
   - Ensure consistency with existing patterns

### Structure
The `components.html` file is organized into sections by component type (buttons, typography, forms, etc.). Each section contains examples that can be referenced when creating new designs.
